No wayyyyyy HAHAH jk LMAO but literally you deserve the best out of life like literally you are one of the most mature people I have ever met like the way you r so responsible and the way you are always spreading happiness around you even if you aren’t feeling the best I appreciate you so much for that and hopefully you continue spreading the same amount of happiness except I hope you are also SUPER happy HAHAH when you do that. Literally KHUSHI you are in college now and I can’t believe we are so far from each other like smh why couldn’t u just come to UT austin it would have been so much easier but its fine we got our random facetime calls where we just laugh for absolutely no reason and where I just laugh at the stupid sounds you make and we have our tea spilling sessions and the random tiktoks we send each other and literally just us sitting there doing our work while listening to music, moments i really hope we continue to have in the future. woah wait I just realized I haven’t heard ur 1 hiccup in so long LMAO but AHHH i have so much more to say but I bet you are very busy having so much fun today and obviously enjoying the work you prolly got from the classes you had today 🤩🤩🤩 so i wanna end this by saying THANK YOU SO MUCH for being the amazing person you are Ik we have had our moments recently and honestly it sucked but that was the past and I am truly so glad to have you in my life and I hope we continue being as close as we are and make even more amazing memories in the future and I hope you have an amazing year ahead and the years after BEING AN ADULT like AAHAHAHHAHA i’m so excited to see all the things you accomplish in life cause IK for a fact you are gonna do so great in the future and you never know next thing im sitting in an auditorium watching you stand on the stage giving a ted talk on how pickles actually taste good(🙄🙄) or one of your 816282828272 inspirational topics AHHAHA BUT YES HAPPY 18TH BIRTHDAY KHUSHI PATEL AKA KHUSSI AKA VELOCIRAPTOR HAVE FUN YOU DESERVE THE BEST 🥳🥳🤩🤩🦖😎🤪🤪🤠🎈🎈🎇 🎂🎂🤧🤧😤😤😵‍💫😵‍💫😮‍💨😮‍💨🎉🎉🎊🎊🎈
